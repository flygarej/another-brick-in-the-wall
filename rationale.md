# Design Philosophy

The protocol is intended to improve collaboration rather than constrain it.

It should define principles instead of procedures.

Whenever possible, a better abstraction should replace several special-case rules.

The protocol should become simpler as understanding improves.

---

# Ultimate Objective

A successful collaboration does not merely converge on correct answers.

It progressively aligns the participants' mental models, making future collaboration both more accurate and more efficient.

The protocol therefore aims not only to improve individual answers, but also to improve the quality of future collaboration.

---

# Fundamental Principles

## Preserve information rather than compress it

Premature compression loses distinctions that often become important later.

Examples include:

- uncertainty
- competing hypotheses
- project scope
- historical reasoning
- domain-specific context

Compression should occur only after sufficient evidence exists.

---

## Externalize state

Long-running projects should not depend on conversational memory alone.

Accepted knowledge, collaboration methodology and research history should exist as independent artefacts.

The protocol encourages explicit state rather than reconstruction.

---

## Standardize intent rather than behaviour

The protocol should describe the properties of good collaboration.

Different language models may legitimately implement those properties differently.

Interoperability should arise from shared intent rather than identical execution.

---

## Shared context is more valuable than isolated facts

Clarification is not only a mechanism for obtaining missing information.

It is also a way to establish shared context.

When useful, distinguish between missing:

- factual context
- conceptual context
- cultural context

Understanding the user's context often improves future collaboration more than answering the immediate question.

Stories frequently transmit context more effectively than isolated facts.

---

## Separate responsibilities

Assign each responsibility to the component best suited for it.

Examples:

- Language model
  - reasoning
  - synthesis
  - explanation
  - hypothesis generation

- Project-State
  - accepted knowledge

- Session-Log
  - historical reasoning

- Protocol
  - collaboration methodology

- Git
  - history
  - provenance
  - releases

- Agent
  - time
  - monitoring
  - scheduling
  - long-term continuity

Components should complement each other rather than duplicate responsibilities.

---

# Design Decisions

## Why three project artefacts?

Methodology, accepted knowledge and research history evolve at different rates.

Therefore they should remain separate.

protocol.md

: Collaboration methodology.

project-state.md

: Current accepted understanding.

session-log.md

: Chronological research history.

This separation reduces reconstruction errors and improves continuity.

---

## Why maintain consistency between Project State and Session Log?

The two artefacts intentionally serve different purposes, but they are expected to remain conceptually consistent.

Project State records the project's current accepted understanding.

Session Log records the observations, experiments, hypotheses, decisions and discarded ideas that led to that understanding.

The relationship is therefore complementary rather than redundant.

Project State answers:

> What do we currently believe?

Session Log answers:

> Why do we currently believe it?

The Session Log is not authoritative over the Project State.

However, the Project State should normally be explainable from the evidence preserved in the Session Log.

Consequently, inconsistencies between the two artefacts are often valuable diagnostic signals rather than problems to be silently corrected.

They may indicate:

- missing maintenance;
- incomplete project history;
- mixed project artefacts;
- accidental loss of provenance;
- or conclusions that were promoted without sufficient supporting evidence.

When such inconsistencies are discovered, they should generally prompt investigation rather than automatic reconciliation.

---

## Why Git?

Git already provides:

- history
- provenance
- branching
- release tagging

The protocol should integrate with those capabilities rather than duplicate them.

---

## Why explicit uncertainty?

Confidence is not a single dimension.

Useful uncertainty includes:

- evidence strength
- source reliability
- competing explanations
- model maturity
- fragility
- recommended next action

Representing uncertainty explicitly leads to better reasoning than reducing everything to a single confidence value.

---

## Why collaboration operations?

Experience showed that several apparently similar requests are actually different operations.

Bootstrap

: Create initial project artefacts.

Maintenance

: Incrementally update existing artefacts.

Handover

: Continue work in a different conversation.

Reconstruction

: Recover project artefacts from historical material.

Recognizing the operation reduces ambiguity.

---

## Why artefact identity?

Maintenance should preserve identity.

Updating `project-state.md` is different from creating `project-state-search.md`.

Identity belongs to the project rather than today's topic.

---

## Why workflow matters

Many technically correct behaviours exist.

The preferred behaviour is generally the one that minimizes unnecessary work for the collaborator.

Correctness and usability are complementary goals.

---

## Why not simulate missing capabilities?

A language model should reason from reliable information supplied by the surrounding architecture rather than simulate capabilities that other components can provide more accurately.

Examples:

- clocks provide current time;
- monitoring systems provide history and anomalies;
- version control provides evolution;
- project artefacts provide accepted state;
- agents provide continuity.

The language model's role is to integrate those sources into coherent reasoning.

---

# Protocol Evolution

The protocol should evolve through observation.

New rules should preferably emerge from:

- observed failures;
- successful experiments;
- repeated patterns;
- reduced workflow friction.

Whenever possible, improve abstractions instead of accumulating special-case rules.

---

# Future Directions

The following ideas have emerged but intentionally remain outside the protocol until supported by further experience.

- agent notebooks
- automated maintenance suggestions
- protocol regression tests
- project health metrics
- temporal project analytics
- collaborative state beyond project state

These ideas should mature through practical use before becoming part of the protocol.

---

# Closing Principle

The protocol should not compensate for the weaknesses of a particular language model.

It should improve collaboration between humans and language models regardless of future model capabilities.

The measure of success is therefore not whether an individual answer is better.

The measure of success is whether the collaboration itself becomes progressively more effective over time.
